# Surprise-Housing-Advanced-Regression

> A US Real Estate Company called Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. 
The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher 
price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. 
 

The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. 
We will build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the 
prospective properties which will help Surprise Housing decide whether to invest in them or not.

## General Information
- The objective of the project is to build an advanced regression model to predict the house price based on the changes in different variables.
- We have a moderately big data set with about 81 columns and 1460 rows. The data needed some cleaning and re arrangement in terms of the values represented for better clarity and understanding
- Business Problem
1. Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house

2. How well those variables describe the price of a house.?


## Conclusions
- The data was very complex and the Simple Linearc Regression Model could not perform well
- The model needed Regularization to be performed in order for the large coeff to be suppressed using penalty
- Ridge Regularization gave us the best results and so we chose that model to be more apt for this scenario



## Technologies Used
- Python, Numpy, Pandas
- matplotlib, Seaborn
- sklearn and statsmodel
